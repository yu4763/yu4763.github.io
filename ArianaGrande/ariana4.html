        I've been here all night
        I've been here all day
        And boy got me walkin' side to side
        Let them hoes know

        I'm talkin' to ya
        See you standing over there with your body
        Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
        And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
        'bout nothin'
        I'm comin' at ya
        Cause I know you got a bad reputation
        Doesn't matter cause you give me temptation
        And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin'
        'bout nothin'

        These friends keep talkin' way too much
        Saying I should give you up
        Can't hear them no cause I

        I've been here all night
        I've been here all day
        And boy got me walkin' side to side
        I've been here all night
        I've been here all day
        And boy got me walkin' side to side
        side to side

        Been tryna hide it
        Baby what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?
        Makin' everybody think that we solo
        Just as long as you know you got me
        you got me
        And boy I got ya
        Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
        And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
        Just as long as you know you got me

        These friends keep talkin' way too much
        Saying I should give you up
        Can't hear them no cause I

        I've been here all night
        I've been here all day
        And boy got me walkin' side to side
        side to side
        I've been here all night
        Been here all night baby
        I've been here all day
        Been here all day baby
        And boy got me walkin' side to side
        side to side

        This the new style with the fresh type of flow
        Wrist icicle ride dick bicycle
        Come true yo get you this type of blow
        If you wanna menage I got a tricycle

        All these bitches flows is my mini-me
        Body smoking so they call me young Nicki chimney
        Rappers in they feelings cause they feelin' me
        Uh I-I give zero fucks and I got zero chill in me
        Kissing me copped the blue box that say Tiffany
        Curry with the shot just tell 'em to call me Stephanie
        Gun pop and I make my gum pop
        I'm the queen of rap young Ariana run pop

        These friends keep talkin' way too much
        Saying I should give him up
        Can't hear them no cause I

        I've been here all night
        I've been here all day
        And boy got me walkin' side to side
        side to side
        I've been here all night
        Been here all night baby
