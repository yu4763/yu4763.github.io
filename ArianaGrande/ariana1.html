      <pre>
        I'd like to say we gave it a try
        I'd like to blame it all on life
        Maybe we just weren't right,
        but that's a lie, that's a lie
        And we can deny it as much as we want
        but in time our feelings will show
        'Cause sooner or later
        We'll wonder why we gave up
        The truth is everyone knows
        Almost, almost it never enough
        So close to being in love
        If I would have known that you wanted me
        The way I wanted you
        Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
        But right here in each others arms
        Here we almost,
        we almost knew what love was
        But almost is never enough
        If I could change the world overnight
        There'd be no such thing as goodbye
        You'll be standing right where you were
        And we'd get the chance we deserve
        Try to deny it as much as you want
        But in time our feelings will show
        'Cause sooner or later
        We'll wonder why we gave up
        The truth is everyone knows
        Almost, almost it never enough
        So close to being in love
        If I would have known that you wanted me
        The way I wanted you
        Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
        But right here in each others arms
        Here we almost,
        we almost knew what love was
        But almost is never enough
        we can deny it as much as we want
        but in time our feelings will show
        'Cause sooner or later
        We'll wonder why we gave up
        The truth is everyone knows
        Almost, almost it never enough
        (is never enough, babe)
        We were so close to being in love (so close)
        If I would have known that you wanted me
        The way I wanted you, babe
        Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
        But right here in each others arms
        Here we almost,
        we almost knew what love was
        But almost is never enough
