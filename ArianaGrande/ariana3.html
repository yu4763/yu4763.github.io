        Aye

        [Ariana:]
        Hey Baby even though I hate ya
        I wanna love ya
        I want you you you
        And even though I cant forgive ya
        I really want to
        I want you you you

        Tell me, tell me baby
        Why cant you leave me
        Cause even though I shouldnt want it
        I gotta have it
        I want you you you

        Head in the clouds
        got no weight on my shoulders
        I should be wiser
        and realise that Ive got

        [Big Sean:]
        One less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less, one less problem
        One less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less, one less problem

        [Ariana:]
        I know your never gonna wake up
        I gotta give up
        But its you you you
        I know I shouldnt ever call back
        Or let you come back
        But its you you you
        Every time you touch me
        And say you love me
        I get a little bit breathless
        I shouldnt want it
        But its you you you

        Head in the clouds
        got no weight on my shoulders
        I should be wiser
        and realise that Ive got

        [Big Sean:]
        One less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less, one less problem
        One less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less, one less problem

        [Iggy:]
        Its Iggy Iggz, uh
        What you got?
        Smart money bettin
        Ill be better off without you
        In no time
        Ill be forgettin all about you
        You saying that you know
        But I really really doubt you
        Understand my life is easy
        When I aint around you
        Iggy Iggy
        Too biggie to be here stressing
        Im think I love the thought go you
        More than I love your presence
        And the best thing now
        Is probably for you to exit
        I let you go
        Let you back
        I finally learned my lesson
        No half-stepping
        Either you want it or you just keep playin
        Im listening to you knowin
        I cant believe what youre sayin
        Theres a million yous baby boy
        So dont be dumb
        I got 99 problems
        But you wont be one
        Like what!

        [Ariana:]
        One less, one less problem
        One less, one less problem

        Head in the clouds
        got no weight on my shoulders
        I should be wiser
        and realise that Ive got

        [Big Sean:]
        One less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less, one less problem
        One less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less problem without ya
        I got one less, one less problem
