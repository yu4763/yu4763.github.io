      <pre>
        There's a fire
        starting in my heart
        Reaching a fever pitch
        it's bringing me out the dark
        Finally I can see you
        crystal clear
        Go 'head and sell me out and
        I'll lay your ship bare
        See how I leave with
        every piece of yo
        Don't underestimate the
        things that I will do
        There's a fire startin
        in my heart
        Reaching a fever pitch
        And it's bringing me out the dar
        The scars of your lov
        remind me of us
        They keep me thinking that
        we almost had it all
        The scars of your love
        they leave me breathless
        I can't help feeling
        We could have it all
        Rolling in the deep
        You had my heart
        inside your han
        And you played it to the beat
        Baby I have no story to be told
        But I've heard one on you
        And I'm gonna make your head burn
        Think of me in the depths o
        your despair
        Make a home down ther
        As mine sure won't be share
        The scars of your love
        remind me of us
        They keep me thinking that we
        almost had it all
        The scars of your love
        they leave me breathless
        I can't help feeling
        We could have had it all
        Rolling in the deep
        You had my heart inside your hand
        And you played it to the beat
        Could have had it all
        Rolling in the deep
        You had my heart inside your hand
        But you played it with a beating
        Throw your soul through
        every open door
        Count your blessings to find
        what you look for
        Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
        You'll pay me back in kind and
        reap just what you've sown
        We could have had it all
        We could have had it all
        It all it all it all
        We could have had it all
        Rolling in the deep
        You had my heart inside your hand
        And you played it to the beat
        We could have had it all
        Rolling in the deep
        You had my heart
        inside of your hand
        But you played it
        You played it
        You played it
        You played it to the beat
