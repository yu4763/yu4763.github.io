      <pre>
        I heard
        That you're settled down
        That you found a girl
        And you're married now
        I heard
        That your dreams came true
        Guess she gave you things
        I didn't give to you

        Old friend
        Why are you so shy
        It ain't like you to hold back
        Or hide from the light

        I hate to turn up out of the blue
        Uninvited
        But I couldn't stay away
        I couldn't fight it
        I'd hoped you'd see my face
        And that you'd be reminded
        That for me
        It isn't over

        Never mind I'll find
        Someone like you
        I wish nothing but the best for you
        Too.. Don't forget me
        I beg
        I remember you say
        Sometimes it lasts in love
        But sometimes it hurts instead
        Sometimes it lasts in love
        But sometimes it hurts instead
        Yeah

        You'd know
        How the time flies
        Only yesterday
        Was the time of our lives
        We were born and raised
        In a summer haze
        Bound by the surprise
        Of our glory days

        I hate to turn up out of the blue
        Uninvited
        But I couldn't stay away
        I couldn't fight it
        I'd hoped you'd see my face
        And that you'd be reminded
        That for me
        It isn't over
        Yeah

        Never mind I'll find
        Someone like you
        I wish nothing but the best for you
        Too.. Don't forget me
        I beg
        I remember you say
        Sometimes it lasts in love
        But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

        Nothing compares
        No worries, or cares
        Regrets and mistakes
        They're memories made
        Who would have known.. How..
        Bittersweet
        This would taste

        Never mind I'll find
        Someone like you
        I wish nothing but the best for you
        Too.. Don't forget me
        I beg
        I remember you say
        Sometimes it lasts in love
        But sometimes it hurts instead

        Never mind I'll find
        Someone like you
        I wish nothing but the best for you
        Too.. Don't forget me
        I beg
        I remember you say
        Sometimes it lasts in love
        But sometimes it hurts instead
        Sometimes it lasts in love
        But sometimes it hurts instead
        Yeah, Yeah..
