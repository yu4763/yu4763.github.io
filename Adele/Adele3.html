        Hello, it’s me
        I was wondering if
        after all these years you’d like to meet
        To go over everything
        They say that time’s supposed to heal ya
        But I ain’t done much healing
        Hello, can you hear me
        I’m in California dreaming about who we used to be
        When we were younger and free
        I’ve forgotten how it felt
        before the world fell at our feet

        There’s such a difference between us
        And a million miles

        Hello from the other side
        I must have called a thousand times
        To tell you I’m sorry for everything that I’ve done
        But when I call you never seem to be home
        Hello from the outside
        At least I can say that I’ve tried
        To tell you I’m sorry for breaking your heart
        But it don’t matter it clearly
        doesn’t tear you apart anymore

        Hello, how are you
        It’s so typical of me to talk about myself I’m sorry
        I hope that you’re well
        Did you ever make it out of that town
        where nothing ever happened

        Its no secret that the both of us
        Are running out of time

        So hello from the other side
        I must have called a thousand times
        To tell you I’m sorry for everything that I’ve done
        But when I call you never seem to be home
        Hello from the outside
        At least I can say that I’ve tried
        To tell you I’m sorry for breaking your heart
        But it don’t matter it clearly
        doesn’t tear you apart anymore

        Highs highs highs highs
        Lows lows lows lows

        Highs highs highs highs
        Lows lows lows lows

        Highs highs highs highs
        Lows lows lows lows

        Highs highs highs highs
        Lows lows lows lows
        Hello from the other side
