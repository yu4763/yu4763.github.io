      <pre>
        Please don't see
        just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
        Please see me
        reaching out for someone I can't see
        take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
        best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
        I'll be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
        So let's get drunk on our tears and

        God, tell us
        the reason youth is wasted on the young
        It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
        Searching for meaning
        But are we all lost stars,
        trying to light up the dark?

        Who are we?
        Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
        Woe is me
        if we're not careful turns into reality
        Don't you dare let our best memories
        bring you sorrow
        Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
        Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
        Where we're dancing in our tears and

        God, tell us
        the reason youth is wasted on the young
        It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
        Searching for meaning
        But are we all lost stars,
        trying to light up the dark?

        And I thought I saw you out there crying
        And I thought I heard you call my name
        And I thought I heard you out there crying
        Just the same

        God, give us
        the reason youth is wasted on the young
        It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
        Searching for meaning
        But are we all lost stars,
        trying to light up the dark?

        And I thought I saw you out there crying
        And I thought I heard you call my name
        And I thought I heard you out there crying

        But are we all lost stars,
        trying to light up the dark?
        But are we all lost stars,
        trying to light up the dark?
