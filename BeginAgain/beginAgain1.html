      <pre>
      Please don't see
      just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
      Please see me
      reaching out for someone I can't see
      take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
      best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
      I'll be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
      So let's get drunk on our tears and

      God, tell us
      the reason youth is wasted on the young
      It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
      Searching for meaning
      But are we all lost stars,
      trying to light up the dark?

      Who are we?
      Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
      Woe is me
      if we're not careful turns into reality
      Don't you dare let our best memories
      bring you sorrow
      Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
      Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
      Where we're dancing in our tears and

      God, tell us
      the reason youth is wasted on the young
      It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
      Searching for meaning
      But are we all lost stars,
      trying to light up the dark?

      And I thought I saw you out there crying
      And I thought I heard you call my name
      And I thought I heard you out there crying
      Just the same

      God, give us
      the reason youth is wasted on the young
      It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
      Searching for meaning
      But are we all lost stars,
      trying to light up the dark?

      And I thought I saw you out there crying
      And I thought I heard you call my name
      And I thought I heard you out there crying

      But are we all lost stars,
      trying to light up the dark?
      But are we all lost stars,
      trying to light up the dark?
